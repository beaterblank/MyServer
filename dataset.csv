what are the advantages of using o-phthalaldehyde and amino acids as ligands for metal complexes?,"Despite number of successful therapies and drug inventions, cancer is still the most dreadful cause of death. Therefore, it is an extreme indigence to design novel anticancer therapeutics. Researchers have put forth the fact that many of the anticancer, antiviral and antibacterial agents act through binding to nucleic acids.  The interaction between small molecules and DNA can often cause DNA damage in cancer cells resulting in cell death. Many studies indicate that the transition metal complexes can interact non-covalently with DNA by intercalation, groove binding or external electrostatic binding [1]. Among several types of transition metal complexes, copper (II) and zinc (II) complexes are better suited for the hydrolysis of DNA due to their strong Lewis acid properties.    Schiff bases are important ligands in coordination chemistry as they are capable of forming neutral complexes readily with transition metals. These ligands have nitrogen and oxygen as well as nitrogen and sulphur donor atoms in their structures providing good chelating sites for metal ions [2-5]. Therefore, there is a continuing interest in metal complexes of Schiff bases. Thakor et al. in 2010 [6]has reported the mixed ligand complexes of Zn(II) using substituted acetophenones and Schiff bases formed from ethylene diamine and anisaldehyde as DNA cleaving agents for Calf Thymus DNA. Similarly, Neelkantan et al. in 2008 [7]have used o-phthalaldehyde and amino acids as mixed ligands for the chelation of Cu (II), Co (II) and Zn (II). He succeeded to prove these water coordinated metal complexes as efficient DNA cleaving agents under aerobic conditions. Prathapchandra Kurup et al. reported the Zn (II) metal complexes of thiosemicarbazones as anti-infective agents in 2003 [8].Therefore, the interaction of transition metal complexes, especially those containing planar aromatic heterocyclic functional groups ligands can insert and stack into the base pairs of DNA duplex [9–11], have attracted considerable attention.

what is the advantage of using agarose gel electrophoresis for separating and analyzing dna?,"  DNA binding study is carried out using λ DNA. Agarose gel electrophoresis is done to determine the same. It is the easiest and general method of separating and analyzing DNA as compared to UV spectroscopic titrations, fluorescence titrations etc.  It is advantageous because of easier handling and it does not denature the samples and the samples can also be recovered. Agarose gel is prepared by mixing 0.25g agarose with 1M solution of TAE (Tris Acetic acid EDTA) buffer solution, readily available in most gel electrophoresis kits. The pH of the TAE buffer is kept around 8.0.  DNA samples are loaded on to the lane.Ethidium bromide intercalates with the double stranded structure of DNA and is necessary in order to view DNA under UV visible trans-illumination. After loading the samples in the lanes, a potential difference of around 50 to 100 mV is applied across the electrodes of the gel apparatus. DNA was seen gradually moving from the negative electrode to positive electrode as seen by the movement of the tracking dye bromophenol blue."
